<p>ZHTML component set.</p>

<h2>Implementation Consideration</h2>

<p>Currently, zhtml depends on zul, but it is not necessary.
If we implement Fileupload and Messagebox in different way, such
dependence could be removed. This might be important when we support
XAML and user might want to minimize the foot print.</p>
