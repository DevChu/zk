<label multiline="true">
When a combobox popup is to tall to be opened bellow the combobox, it is opened from the top of the current frame instead.
If the combobox text-input is in the middle of the page, it can be covered by the drop down popup menu, which makes typing difficult.

click the combobox, if the bottom space is not enouth to show popup, the popup will try to show on top of text-input;
if the top space is not enouth either, the popup will force show on the bottom of text-input.
