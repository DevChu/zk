		Only with websocket enabled

		1. unmark the session-config of ZK-3915 in zk.xml to enable automatic session timeout
		2. look into browser devtool tab Network
		3. enable [Preserve log] and filter [XHR, Doc, WS] requests
		4. when the websocket connection timeouts, it'll redirect to the same page.
		5. reload this page right after the websocket connection has connected.
		6. automatic session-timeout should still work
		(work means session and desktop should both change continuously with gaps around 10 secs)
		7. should not have any exception thrown
