            This fiddle simulates a real world scenario where we have a large tree and then the user can start an async operation that creates a new model and assign it to the tree (no its not built around echoEvent in real life).
            When starting the refresh we clear the current model of the tree, and somehow this seems to cause the scroll position to be left lingering at the client side.
            1. Scroll to the middle of the tree around item 8000 or so
            2. Click the button
            3. The new model is loaded, but the scroll position is left at the middle of the tree and nothing but blank is shown
            4. Scroll down in the tree somewhat and the client realizes that it needs to render some items and they appear on screen
