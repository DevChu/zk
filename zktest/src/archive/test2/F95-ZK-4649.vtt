Welcome and thanks for participating in this course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm Filip Cossaer and would like to share with you the basic concept of ZK framework.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and how we can use ZK to build web applications.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
ZK is a framework that enables Java developers to create web applications fast and easily.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Some of the most interesting key features includes:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
No Ajax knowledge required because framework does for you.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
No JavaScript knowledge required because all of framework does it for you.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's easy to pick up.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's highly productive, some example is like I finished my latest project in 4 months.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
While I was working alone on the backend and frontend.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm not an expert works already many years in the framework.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I just have 2 years of experiences in ZK framework.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And most it's highly secured.
