zweb: The ZK Web Library
------------------------

Libraries to develop Web applications.

It contains the most fundamental utilities, while pat is framework-oriented.
It assumes nothing but Servlet/JSP/Portlet/JSF/JSTL standards.

It doesn't depend on any of i3pb, i3po and i3lb. With a few modification,
codes in this module could work with any other projects.
